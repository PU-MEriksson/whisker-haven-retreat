## üõ†Ô∏è Reflections and Areas for Improvement

This project was created as part of a school assignment, with the main focus on backend development, API integration, and maintaining a clear code structure. I'm proud of some
 
- Organized file structure and modular, well-organised code   
- Meaningful version control with consistent and descriptive commit history

At the same time, there are a few areas I would improve if I had more time:

- **Accessibility (a11y):** Color contrasts could be optimised for better readability  
- **Visual design:** Layout and color choices could be refined for a more polished and modern look  
- **Responsiveness:** This site is made for desktop only, so that it could be improved to work on smaller screens as well.  

While I‚Äôm currently focusing on other projects, I‚Äôm aware of these issues and will carry those lessons forward into future work.
